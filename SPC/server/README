We had done the server side using php

login.php                             --- A page to login
register.php		              --- to register new user
up.php                                --- main page after login.php
add_file.php    		      --- to add given file in the database
config.php			      --- to configure the connection
forgot_pass.php and reset_pass.php    --- if forgot password to reset it
get_file.php   			      --- to view file
web_list.php			      --- to view the files with complete directory structure
set_reminder.php                      --- to set reminder for the user with his/her preferencec   
enc_schema.html                       --- stores the encryption schema and key in local browser storage

Start the server by using "php -S 0.0.0.0:8000" command then use the above files accordingly.
