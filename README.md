# SPC (Secure Personal Cloud)
The goal of the project is to develop a Secure Personal Cloud for users.

The cloud is Secure as all the files uploaded to the server are encrypted before storing to the database. So, the user's data is completely safe and cannot be accessed even by a security breach on the server side.

There are three clients: Linux, Web and Android.

All the data sync happens via the Linux client. In addition, the users can (only)access the data from Web or Android.

The users cannot use Web or Android client to upload any data.

## Getting Started

## Installation

```
sudo bash install.sh
```
It will install a Linux command `spc`.

## Usage

```
